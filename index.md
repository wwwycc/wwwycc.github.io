## About Me

I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student at the School of Mathematical Sciences, Tongji University, Shanghai, China, where I am advised by Prof. [Hao Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BpJevpQAAAAJ). I earned my bachelor's degree in Statistics from Tongji University in 2021. From Jul. 2023 to Feb. 2025, I interned at ByteDance Research, where I engaged in protein dynamics research. 

## Research Interests

- **Sampling problems using deep learning methods:** efficient sampling of high-dimensional distributions, molecular systems and complex physical systems
- **Protein Conformations generation:** using thermodynamic and kinetic information to generate protein conformations
